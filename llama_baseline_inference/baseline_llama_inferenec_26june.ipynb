It is true that it's hard to attend classes because of tiredness and laziness. However, I think university students should have its own duty to attend the classes.\\n\\n  First reason of duty on attending classes for university students is reasons of attending university. When we think of the reasons why we enter the university, we can derive many reasons for that. Even if we have lots of reasons for entering university, I think most of us came here to study or to specialize what we want to do in our future. So, classes provides you about those information which you need for future. Which mean, when you do not attend classes, you do not have a future plan.\\n  Second reason of attending in classes is about your promises. When you choose the classes to attend that semester, you may not know but it is kind of promises that you'll attend classes and listen carefully to get what you want in this classes. To think that it is optional to attend classes is same with making your promises optional. You know that you can't change promises because of your change of mind. Attending classes is to keep your promises with professors.\\n  Third reason is regarded with money. You may not know about the value of classes because most of KAIST's students does not pay for it, and even if you pay for it, it's cheap. However, when you get some information about the classes's value for other university, you may surprised by its cost. What I think is when you pay for your classes, you have to attend the classes  to get that value meaningful for your life. You should use your money for you not for other.\\n\\nThis is all my opinion about why we have to attend the classes in the university. We does not live forever and our time is finite. Spend your capital for you and live where you want to live by attending classes.\",\n          \"Almost rooms of university's dormitory are not individual room.And individual room is more expensive. So almost student choose to live with their roommates. They can choose their roommate, or school choose their roommate randomly. In my case, I don't want to live with random roommate, so I contact with other students to choose my roommate. There are three reasons why I think choosing roommate myself is better than random roommate. \\nFirst, I can choose roommate who has similar sleeping cycle. For example, I go to the bed at 12 a.m. and wake up at 7 a.m. It's not common case in KAIST. I go the bed earlier than other students and I also wake up earlier than most students. It's hard to live together in a same room, if you and your roommate's sleeping cycle is so different. Imagine that you really want to go to bed, however your roommate doing her work, you can't turn off the light to go to bed of course, and you can't sleep well with roommate who doing his/her work. Since I want to choose roommate who has similar sleeping cycle, so I want to choose my own roommate .\\nSecond, I don't have any information of random roommate. Maybe she is bad at cleaning her room, or she don't clear herself, or she always talk to the phone loudly, etc. In my high school, a girl  always talk to her boyfriend until the late night. Her roommate, my best friend,  couldn't sleep well because of her voice and light of her phone.  I think I can't stand out with that types of roommates. But if I choose my roommates, I can search and ask about my roommate whether she is nice, and clean. Choosing by university has high probability of meeting weird roommates.\\nLastly, I can share room with my friends. I guess most people prefer to share their room with their friends than strangers. If you share dormitory room with your friends, you can feel like having school trip everyday, you can talk each other all night, and you can eat delicious food with your friends in your room! I think it must be nice experience to everyone. And fact, many students choose their friends to roommate until now. \\nThese three reasons show why I think choosing roommate myself is better than choosing random roommate by university. I can choose roommate who has similar sleeping cycle for my comfortable sleep, I can avoid someone who doesn't accept to living together and I can share dormitory room with my friends. If you worry about your new roommate, I recommend you to find your roommate yourself. It must be better than choosing by university.\",\n          \"    Almost all of KAIST class must use the English. But it has many inefficient points. So if I can change one thing in KAIST, I  want to change about English usage policy in KAIST.\\n    First, sometimes English is inefficient to understand difficult class. When students study about their major class, it is not easy. But, not only difficult major but also English is stress. When students learn about difficult thing, often english is inefficient. \\n    Second, KAIST English lecture curriculum is good. So if KAIST extend neccesity English lecture, it will be good choice for student's English skills. Every class don't have to use English.\\n    Third, I felt difficult to study. It is very personal thing. English was my complex. When I study major lecture, always I find word's meaning. Sometimes I couldn't question to professor. Because I didn't say my question at English. Also I know that English is very important. Nevertheless KAIST's English policy is bad way for some students.\\n    In conclusion, KAIST's English policy is inefficient about many cases. So I want to change. Every class don't have to use Englsih. And I want to extend English curriculum in KAIST. Then students' studying efficiency will increase.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8545804965515573,\n        \"min\": 0.5,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5,\n          4.0,\n          2.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"organization\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8101404295941284,\n        \"min\": 0.5,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5,\n          4.0,\n          4.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"language\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.729714367703162,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          3.5,\n          2.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"total\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2.265966083222032,\n        \"min\": 3.5,\n        \"max\": 14.5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 23,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4.5,\n          8.0,\n          10.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"content_analysis\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 396,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The strengths of this essay lie in its clear and coherent structure, with each paragraph presenting a distinct reason to support the argument that university students should attend classes.
