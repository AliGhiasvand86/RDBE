Strengths: * The essay attempts to provide reasons to support the opinion, such as the limited resources on Earth, the lack of a living land, and the potential for space exploration. * The writer provides some relevant examples, such as the use of oil and the lack of a living land, which adds credibility to their argument. Weaknesses: * The essay lacks clear and concise thesis statement, making it difficult to understand the writer's main argument. * The reasons provided are not well-developed and lack specific examples to support the claims. For instance, the writer mentions the limited resources on Earth, but does not provide a concrete example of how these resources will be used in the future. * The writing lacks clarity, with sentences often being difficult to understand due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. To improve, the writer should focus on providing more specific and detailed examples to support their reasons, and work on clarifying their thesis statement to make it easier to understand. --->
